# Stronghold Crusader v1.41 Modding Tool Source Code

My YouTube channel (in polish): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoXkCve5-st9MRelXa09lxQ

Real time modding for Stronghold Crusader game. You'll have to inject created dll into the main game process to make it work.

To inject the dll you can use my simple DllInjector.

Source Code: https://github.com/game-tools/dll-injector-sc

Compiled program: https://github.com/game-tools/dll-injector

It is possible that your antivirus will detect it as a threat, but don't worry, It does detect it because the program can modify other process memory. If you'd like to, you can always get the source code and compile it on your own.

## Compiled version

You can also download already compiled dll with every needed config file here: https://github.com/game-tools/shc-modding-tool

Have Fun!! :)
